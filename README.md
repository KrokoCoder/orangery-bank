# Orangery Bank

Orangery Bank is an open-source version of Orange Bank used in The Orange Squad, managed by the Orangery Development Team. It is a simple banking system that allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and view their account balance. Additionally, a levelling system is implemented to reward users for their activity. Based off an old version of Orange Bank, captured before the original bot was rewritten using Rust.
